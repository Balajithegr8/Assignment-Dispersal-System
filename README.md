# Assignment-Dispersal-System
Asgn. is an innovative platform that aims to reduce the stress of assignment dumps by increasing cross-subject transparency and tracking student progress. With features such as a global calendar, ML generated deadline suggestions, and model-generated assessments, Asgn. aims to improve student efficiency and reduce conflicts in student workloads.

#Description
Assignment dumps in a limited span are quite taxing on students. The main reason for this is the lack of transparency between subjects and untracked progress, leading to workflow conflicts and a hit on efficiency. Asgn. aims to solve both of these problems by introducing a global calendar for teachers with machine learning (ML) generated deadline suggestions based on students' data sets and other subject workloads. Asgn. also aims to improve student progress by providing model-generated assessments that are purely for improving core knowledge of the subject.

Asgn. is designed to be used by both students and teachers. The teacher side of the platform allows teachers to create and upload marked assignments, view the global calendar, and see a home feed with the latest posted assessments, along with ML generated ones. The student side of the platform includes a student home feed with the latest posted assessments, a due date, and estimated completion time, deadline notifications, and a distinct color-coded subject calendar.

The global calendar feature in Asgn. aims to increase cross-subject transparency and reduce conflicts in student workloads. By using ML generated deadline suggestions based on students' data sets and other subject workloads, Asgn. helps to ensure that students are not overwhelmed with assignments from multiple subjects at the same time.

Tracking and improving student progress is another key aspect of Asgn. By providing model-generated assessments that are purely for improving core knowledge of the subject, Asgn. helps students to identify areas where they need to improve and gives them the opportunity to focus on those areas. This is especially useful for students who are struggling to keep up with the material.
